Here is an example test environment for a working OpenStack-Ansible (OSA) deployment with a small number of servers.

This example environment has the following characteristics:

- One infrastructure node for the **control plane** host (32 vCPU, 128 GB RAM, 2 TB RAID1 HDD)
- One compute node (32 vCPU, 128 GB RAM, 2 TB RAID1 HDD)
- One Storage node (2 vCPU,  64 GB RAM, 2 TB RAID1 HDD).
- Dual Port  Network Interface Card (NIC) for each host
- Internet access via the router address `192.168.10.1` on the Management Network

The following figure depicts this test environment and its components.

## Network Architecture

In our test environment each has a dual port Ethernet card and we will configure our test environment network as a multiple interfaces as depicted by the diagram below.

## Network CIDR/VLAN Assignments

The following CIDR and VLAN assignments are used for this environment.

**Network**	           |        **CIDR**	   | **VLAN**
-----------------------|---------------------|-------------
Management Network     |	`172.29.236.0/22`	 | `10`
Tunnel (VXLAN) Network | 	`172.29.240.0/22`  | `30`
Storage Network        |	`172.29.244.0/22`  | `20`

## IP Assignments

The following host name and IP address assignments are used for this environment.

**Host name** |	**Management IP**  |	**Tunnel (VxLAN) I/P**  |	**Storage IP**
--------------|--------------------|--------------------------|--------------
infra1        |	`172.29.236.11`    |	`172.29.240.11`  	      | `172.29.244.11`
compute1	    | `172.29.236.12`    |	`172.29.240.12`         |	`172.29.244.12`
storage1	    | `172.29.236.13`    |	 `-`                    | `172.29.244.13`

##  Configuring the Operating System

This section covers how to install and configure **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS server** in our OpenStack-Ansible host.

## Install the Operating System

If your have downloaded your Ubuntu server image download the installation ISO from alternate download section.

### Alternative Ubuntu Server installer

Since we  require advanced networking and storage features such as; LVM, RAID, multipath, vlans, bonds, or re-using existing partitions, you will want to continue to use the alternate installer.

[Download the alternate installer](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/18.04.2/release/ubuntu-18.04.2-server-amd64.iso)

!!! Note
    We do not cover on how to install the Ubuntu server here. We assume that you already know howto do it.

!!! Important
    We also recommend setting your locale to en_US.UTF-8. Other locales might work, but they are not tested or supported.

### Configure Ubuntu

**1\.** Update package source lists
```
sudo apt-get update
```
**2\.** Upgrade the system packages and kernel:
```
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```
**3\.** Reboot the host.
```
sudo systemctl reboot
```
**4\.** Ensure that the kernel version is `3.13.0-34-generic` or later:
```
uname -r
```
**5\.** Install additional software packages:
```
sudo apt-get install bridge-utils debootstrap ifenslave ifenslave-2.6 lsof lvm2 chrony openssh-server sudo tcpdump vlan python
```
**6\.**  Install the kernel extra package if you have one for your kernel version
```
sudo apt install linux-image-extra-$(uname -r)
```
**7\.** Add the appropriate kernel modules to the `/etc/modules` file to enable VLAN and bond interfaces:
```
sudo echo 'bonding' >> /etc/modules && sudo  echo '8021q' >> /etc/modules
```
**8\.** Configure Network Time Protocol (NTP) in `/etc/chrony/chrony.conf` to synchronize with a suitable time source and restart the service:
```
sudo systemctl enable chrony
sudo restart chrony
```
**9\.** Reboot the host to activate the changes and use the new kernel.
```
sudo systemctl reboot
```
##  Configure The Network  Interfaces.

This section describes how to configure network interfaces of your host so that it can be used in OpenStack Ansible deployment.

### Changing `netplan` to `ifupdown`

The classic `ifupdown` network configuration used in Debian/Ubuntu  has been replaced by `netplan` on Ubuntu 18.04 server system.

You can view the current `netplan` configuration using  the command below. You may have a different name for your `YML` as per your installation environment.

```
cat /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml
```

You will get an output like below.
```
# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
# For more information, see netplan(5).
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    enp0s3:
      dhcp4: yes
```   

To re-enable `ifupdown` on this system, run:
```
sudo apt install ifupdown
```                                        
### Consistent Naming for Network Interfaces

New versions of Linux Kernel, including the one in our Ubuntu server name the network interfaces using a new convention based on the network interface type (PCI, PCIe, Onboard, Wireless, etc.,) and the relative position of the motherboard which we have slotted the specific card. For example, you may get interface names like `enp0s3, eno1, p2p1` etc. While this is an advantageous in many cases as it provides consist ant name of each interface during our OpenStack-Ansible deployment we are going to rename them back to our traditional naming convention `eth0, eth1`, and so on.

To get back to `ethX` again will do the following configurations

```
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
```
Look for `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX`  and add the following `net.ifnames=0 biosdevname=0`.

**From:**
```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=""
```
**To:**

```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="net.ifnames=0 biosdevname=0"
```
Generate a new grub file using the following command.
```
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```
Now reboot your systems

```
sudo systemctl reboot
```
Now check your interface name:
```
ip link show
```
You should get an output like below:
```
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 08:00:27:cb:31:f1 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
3: eth1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 08:00:27:b4:05:38 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
```
