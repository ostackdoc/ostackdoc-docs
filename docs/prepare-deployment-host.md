In this section we are going to discuss how we are going to prepare OpenStack-Ansible host. This is the host that will hold the OpenStack-Ansible playbook Repository and deployment configurations.

Since this guide has been prepared using Ubuntu Linux 18.04 LTS operating systems you will not find the instructions on configuring other supported operating systems for OpenStack-Ansible. Please refer to the respective configurations manuals of those operating systems and adjust a particular configuration that suits your needs.
